# s3-to-redshift

A utility to load files from S3 to Redshift.

## Usage without docker

```sh
$ lein run -m s3-to-redshift.core config.edn
```

This will:

* find data files in S3 as specified by the config file
* check which ones have not yet been loaded
* group them in batches and create corresponding manifest files
* execute redshift's COPY commands
* and mark the files as loaded.

You need to first create a table to track loaded files:

```SQL
create table s3_loaded_file(table_name varchar, url varchar(2048), create_time timestamp default sysdate, primary key (table_name, url));
```

The table name can be different, you just have to specify it in the config file.

See the [example config](config.sample.edn), hopefully self-explanatory.

## Usage with docker

On a system that supports docker, you can simply run this without installing anything:

```sh
docker run -it -v /your/path/to/config.edn:/tmp/config.edn  -e AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=XXX -e AWS_SECRET_KEY=YYY yummly/s3-to-redshift /tmp/config.edn
```

When running on an EC2 instance, omit the AWS environment variables to use instance credentials.
